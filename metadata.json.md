# Documentation for `metadata.json`

## 1. Purpose

This file provides essential metadata and configuration settings for the application's host environment. The platform that runs this web app reads this file to understand basic information about the app and to grant specific browser permissions it might need to function correctly.

## 2. File Structure and Properties

- **`name`**: `string`
  - The display name of the application. In this case, "FeVeDucation".

- **`description`**: `string`
  - A brief summary of the application's purpose and features. This can be used for SEO or for display in an app marketplace.

- **`requestFramePermissions`**: `string[]`
  - This is a critical field for security and functionality. It is an array of strings that declares which special browser permissions the application requires to operate.
  - **Examples**:
    - If the app needed to access the user's webcam, you would add `"camera"` to this array.
    - If the app needed to access the microphone, you would add `"microphone"`.
  - Currently, the array is empty, meaning the application does not require any special permissions beyond standard web access.

- **`prompt`**: `string`
  - This field is likely used by the hosting framework as an initial instruction or context, possibly for an AI-driven development environment. It is currently empty.

## 3. Connections & Dependencies

This file has no direct dependencies on other code files within the project. Instead, the **hosting environment depends on this file**. It's a configuration input for the platform itself.

## 4. For Backend/Porting

- The structure of this file is **specific to the hosting environment**.
- When migrating to a different platform (like Vercel, Netlify, a standard Node.js server, or a WordPress site), you will need to find the equivalent configuration file for that platform.
  - In a Node.js project, some of this information would live in `package.json`.
  - In a native mobile app, this would be in `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android) or `Info.plist` (iOS).
  - In a WordPress environment, this metadata might be managed via a theme's `style.css` header or a plugin's main file header.
- The most important part to port is the `requestFramePermissions`. Always ensure the new platform is correctly configured to request any necessary hardware access.
