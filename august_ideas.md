A way for free-tier users to access premium features on a pay-as-you-go basis.

## 5. Strategic Partnerships

Leverage the platform's user base for B2B partnerships.

- **Sponsored Content:** Collaborate with educational publishers (e.g., Pearson, McGraw Hill) to feature sponsored, high-quality content aligned with their curricula.
