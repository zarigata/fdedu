# Documentation for `services/geminiService.ts`

## 1. Purpose

This file was likely intended to be the dedicated service layer for all interactions with the Google Gemini API. However, it is currently **empty and obsolete**.

## 2. Current Status

The functionality that would have lived here has been consolidated into the more generic `services/aiService.ts` file.

The `aiService.ts` file now handles interactions with **both** Google Gemini and OpenRouter, providing a unified interface for the rest of the application. This is a better architectural approach as it allows the application to switch between AI providers without changing the components that call the service.

## 3. For Backend/Porting

This file can be safely deleted. All backend and porting considerations related to AI integration should refer to the documentation for `services/aiService.ts`.
