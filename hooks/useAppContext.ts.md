# Documentation for `hooks/useAppContext.ts`

## 1. Purpose

This file defines a custom React hook, `useAppContext`, which serves as a clean and safe way for components to access the global application state provided by `AppContext`.

## 2. Key Functionality

- **Simplifies Context Consumption**: Instead of every component needing to import `useContext` from React and `AppContext` from the context file, they can now import a single, purpose-built hook: `useAppContext`.

- **Error Handling**: The hook includes a crucial safety check. It verifies that `useContext(AppContext)` does not return `undefined`.
  - This would happen if a component tries to call `useAppContext` without being a descendant of the `<AppProvider>` component.
  - If the context is `undefined`, it throws an error with a clear message: `useAppContext must be used within an AppProvider`. This immediately alerts the developer to a mistake in the component tree structure, preventing hard-to-debug runtime errors.

## 3. How It's Used

In any component that needs to read or modify global state, you would use it like this:

```typescript
import { useAppContext } from '../hooks/useAppContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // Destructure the specific state or functions you need
  const { user, logout } = useAppContext();

  if (!user) {
    return <p>Please log in.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello, {user.name}</p>
      <button onClick={logout}>Log Out</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This pattern is cleaner and more maintainable than importing and using the context directly everywhere.

## 5. For Backend/Porting

- This hook is a frontend-specific pattern related to React's Context API.
- The hook itself wouldn't be ported directly to a different framework, but the **concept** is universal.
- In any component-based framework (like Vue, Svelte, or Angular), you would create a similar custom hook or function that provides a clean, validated entry point to your global state management system (e.g., a Vue composable for Pinia, or a service in Angular).
- The key takeaway is the importance of creating simple, reusable, and safe "accessors" for shared application services or state.
