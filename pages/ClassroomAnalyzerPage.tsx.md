# Documentation for `pages/ClassroomAnalyzerPage.tsx`

## 1. Purpose

This page was originally designed to provide teachers with AI-driven analysis of student submissions for a specific assignment.

## 2. Current Status: Obsolete and Integrated

This file is now **empty and no longer in use**. Its core functionality has been refactored and integrated into two more powerful and contextually appropriate pages:

1.  **`pages/GradingPage.tsx`**: This page now serves as the primary interface for teachers to view individual student submissions for an assignment.

2.  **`pages/GradesOverviewPage.tsx`**: This new, more advanced page has taken over the AI analysis role. It allows teachers to trigger a comprehensive AI analysis of the **entire gradebook** for a class, providing much deeper insights, student knowledge profiles with radar charts, and class-wide performance reports.

This refactoring provides a better user experience by placing submission viewing and grading in one logical place, and elevating the AI analysis to a more holistic, class-wide tool.

## 3. For Backend/Porting

This file can be safely **deleted**. All development effort and porting considerations for assignment analysis should now focus on the backend APIs required for `pages/GradesOverviewPage.tsx`.
