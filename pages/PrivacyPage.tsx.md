# Documentation for `pages/PrivacyPage.tsx`

## 1. Purpose

This page is designed to display the Privacy Policy for the FeVeDucation service. It informs users about what data is collected and how it is used, stored, and protected.

## 2. Key Content

- **Placeholder Text**: Similar to the `TermsPage`, the content of this page is explicitly marked as **placeholder text**. It includes standard sections found in a privacy policy, such as:
  - Introduction
  - Information We Collect
  - How We Use Your Information
  - Data Security
  - Contact Information
- **Legal Advice Warning**: While not explicitly stated, the placeholder nature of the text implies that a proper, legally compliant privacy policy should be drafted by a professional.

## 3. Connections & Dependencies

- **`../components/Card`**: The policy text is wrapped in a `Card` for consistent styling with the rest of the application.
- The page is static and has no other dependencies on routing or global application state.

## 4. For Backend/Porting

- This is a pure frontend page.
- As with the `TermsPage`, the content for a live application should either be finalized and hardcoded, or ideally, fetched from a Content Management System (CMS). This would allow legal or administrative staff to update the policy as needed without developer intervention.
- The current structure is simple and easily portable to any other web technology.
