# Documentation for `pages/ProjectHubPage.tsx`

## 1. Purpose

This component is intended to be the central, collaborative workspace for a single student group project. It's the destination when a user clicks "Open Project Hub" from the `ProjectsPage`.

## 2. Current Status: Placeholder

This file is currently a **placeholder**. It renders a simple title and a paragraph to indicate where the future functionality will live. It exists primarily to prevent routing errors in the `App.tsx` file where it is imported.

## 3. Future Vision (Based on `AGOSTPLAN.md`)

The plan is to expand this page into a rich, interactive environment similar to a simplified Miro or Figma board, with features like:

-   **Shared Workboard**: A collaborative space with sticky notes, similar to the main `ClassroomPage`.
-   **Task Management**: A checklist or Kanban-style board for the group to track tasks.
-   **Group Chat**: A dedicated, persistent chat for the project group.
-   **File Sharing**: A repository for project-related files.
-   **AI Project Manager**: An AI assistant that monitors progress, identifies roadblocks, and provides suggestions to the group.

## 4. For Backend/Porting

-   When this feature is built, it will require a backend with **real-time capabilities (WebSockets)**, just like the `ClassroomPage`.
-   **API Endpoints**: You will need endpoints to fetch the project details (`GET /api/projects/{id}`), create tasks, send chat messages, upload files, etc.
-   **WebSocket Events**: Real-time updates for chat, task changes, and workboard notes will need to be broadcast to all members of the group. Each project group would essentially be its own WebSocket "room".
