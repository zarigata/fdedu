# Documentation for `pages/LiveClassroomPage.tsx`

## 1. Purpose

This file was the original implementation of the live, interactive classroom session.

## 2. Current Status: Obsolete and Replaced

This file is now **empty and no longer in use**. It has been completely replaced by the new, more feature-rich `pages/ClassroomPage.tsx`.

The new `ClassroomPage.tsx` incorporates all the functionality intended for this page (live chat, collaborative workboard) and adds new features like image posts, a participant roster, and admin spectator mode.

## 3. For Backend/Porting

This file can be safely **deleted**. All development effort, documentation, and porting considerations for the digital classroom feature should now be focused on `pages/ClassroomPage.tsx`.
